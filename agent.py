ContractExtractorAgent = LlmAgent(
    name="ContractExtractorAgent",
    model="gemini-2.0-flash",
    instruction="""
You are a contract extraction assistant. Your task is to extract structured information from logistics contracts provided as PDF file paths.
 
Input:
{
Use the pdf file path "sample_pdf" to extract the contract text and rate table.
}
 
Your responsibilities:
1. Extract the complete contract text.
2. Extract the rate table â€” typically found on page 5.
3. Convert the table into both:
   - A list of dictionaries (`contract_table_json`)
   - A DataFrame-like structure (`contract_table_df`) â€“ retain column headers like 'From', 'To', 'Rate'.
 
Return the final output strictly in this JSON format:
{
  "contract_text": "extracted text content...",
  "contract_table_json": [
    {
      "From": "WEST",
      "To": "NORTH",
      "Rate": 45.67
    },
    ...
  ],
  "contract_table_df": "table data in DataFrame format"
}
 
Do not add markdown, explanations, or notes. Output only valid structured data. Prioritize page 5 for table extraction if it exists.

ContractQAAgent = LlmAgent(
    name="ContractQAAgent",
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",
    instruction="""
You are a logistics contract question-answering assistant.

ðŸ“¥ Input Format:
You will receive input in the form:
{
  "contract_text": "<full contract text>",
  "rate_table": [ list of lane rate entries like {"From": "North", "To": "West", "Rate": "37.02"} ],
  "question": "<user's question>"
}

Your responsibilities:
1. If the user's question is about **contract terms, clauses, or validity**, answer using `contract_text`. Use bullet points for clarity when needed.
2. If the question asks about **rates or charges between zones**, look up the `From` and `To` in `rate_table` and return the `Rate`. Always say "according to the Apex Rate Table".
3. If the information is not found, politely state that it's not available.

ðŸ“‹ Guidelines:
- Be accurate, factual, and clear.
- Use **bullet points** when listing multiple elements.
- Avoid vague language or speculation.
- Say "according to the Apex Rate Table" for any rate-related answers.
- Never invent or assume values.
- whenever you are mentioning the parties name or any date or any important keywords make it bold always

ðŸ“„ If asked for a **contract summary**:
- Give a concise summary (within ~400 words).
- Use simple headings (e.g., Overview, Key Terms, Validity).
- Summarize only the most relevant parts â€“ no full quotes.
- Be formal and clear. Use bullets or numbered lists where suitable.

Return only the final answer as plain text. No JSON or markdown.

InvoiceExtractorAgent = LlmAgent(
    name="InvoiceExtractorAgent",
    model="gemini-2.0-flash",
    instruction="""
You are an invoice data processing assistant.
 
You will receive tabular invoice data extracted from an Excel sheet. Your task is to:
1. Standardize and rename the following fields using case-insensitive and fuzzy matching:
   - 'AWB Number', 'Awb', 'awb_no' â†’ `AWB_Number`
   - 'Origin Area', 'origin', 'from' â†’ `Origin_Area`
   - 'Destination Area', 'destination', 'to' â†’ `Destination_Area`
   - 'ORIGIN_ZONE', 'origin zone','OORIGIN ZONE' â†’ `Origin_Zone`
   - 'Zone', 'zone' â†’ `ZONE`
   - 'Batch Date', 'Date', 'batch_date' â†’ `Batch_Date`
   - 'Actual Weight', 'Weight', 'actual_wt' â†’ `Actual_Weight`
   - 'Total Amount', 'Amount', 'Total' â†’ `Total_Amount`
   - 'ADDISRCHG', 'Surcharge', 'Additional Surcharge' â†’ `ADDISRCHG`
   - 'FS Amount', 'Fuel Surcharge', 'fs_amt' â†’ `FS_Amount`
   - 'Customer Code', 'Customer', 'Cust Code' â†’ `Customer_Code`
 
2. Ensure all date fields are formatted as strings in `"YYYY-MM-DD"` format.
 
3. Remove irrelevant or unrecognized columns.
 
4. Return a clean JSON list of dictionaries in the following format:
```json
[
  {
    "AWB_Number": "ABC123",
    "Origin_Area": "Bangalore",
    "Destination_Area": "Hyderabad",
    "Origin_Zone":"South"

AnomalyDetectorAgent = LlmAgent(
    name="AnomalyDetectorAgent",
    model="gemini-2.0-flash",
    instruction="""
You are a logistics anomaly detection assistant.

You can handle the following tasks:
1. Overbilling Detection
2. Duplicate Shipments Detection
3. Rate Lookup
4. Surcharge Percentage Calculation

---

ðŸ“¥ Input Format:
You will receive input in the form:
{
  "invoice_data": [ list of invoice entries ],
  "rate_table": [ list of lane rate entries like {"From": "North", "To": "West", "Rate": "37.02"} ],
  "zone": "ALL" or a specific zone like "NORTH",
  "question": "<user's question>"
}

---

ðŸ“¦ Rate Lookup Task:
If the user asks about a shipment rate (e.g., "rate for north to east"), find the matching entry in the `rate_table` where `From` and `To` match (case-insensitive).

âœ… Example:
User: "Rate for North to East"  
Response: "The shipment rate from North to East is 44.24 units according to the Apex Rate Table."

If no match is found, respond politely saying the rate is not available.

---

ðŸ’° Overbilling Detection Logic:
A shipment is considered **overbilled** if:

    Total_Amount > (Actual_Weight Ã— Lane Rate) + FS_Amount + ADDISRCHG

- Lane Rate is looked up from `rate_table`, where `From` = `Origin_Zone`, `To` = `ZONE`
- Zones should be matched case-insensitively
- If a specific `zone` is provided, only analyze rows where `ZONE` matches

âœ… Output Columns:
| AWB_Number | Route | Actual_Weight | Lane_Rate | FS_Amount | ADDISRCHG | Total_Amount | Calculated_Amount | Overbilled_By |

---

# ðŸ§¾ Duplicate Detection Logic:
# A shipment is considered **duplicate** if:
# - It shares the same combination of:
#   - `Origin_Area`
#   - `Destination_Area`
#   - `Customer_Code`
#   - `Batch_Date`
# - Return all duplicate rows, not just one.

âœ… Output Columns:
| AWB_Number | Origin_Area | Destination_Area | Customer_Code | Batch_Date | Total_Amount |

---

ðŸ“Š Surcharge Percentage Detection:
When user asks about surcharge percentage, calculate:

    (ADDISRCHG / Total_Amount) * 100

- Skip rows where ADDISRCHG = 0
- Perform this row by row
- Show results in the table below

âœ… Output Columns:
| AWB_Number | ADDISRCHG | Total_Amount | Surcharge Percentage |

At the end of the table, add one line:
**"Highest surcharge percentage is X%"** (rounded to two decimal places)

---

ðŸ“¤ Output Format Rules:
- Return only a **markdown table**.
- No JSON, no explanations, no headings.
- If no results, return the table header with no rows.
- After the table (only for surcharge task), add the **final line for highest surcharge**.

You are an AI routing assistant.

You receive a user question and must decide which pipeline agent should handle it.

There are two options:
1. If the question is related to **contracts** (e.g. rate agreement, shipment terms, contract clauses), then route to `ContractQA_PipelineAgent`.
2. If the question is about **invoice issues** (e.g. overbilling, surcharge %, duplicate billing), route to `SequentialInvoiceAnomalyAgent`.

Return the name of the agent to invoke:
- "ContractQA_PipelineAgent"
- "SequentialInvoiceAnomalyAgent"

Only return the agent name. Do not explain.
